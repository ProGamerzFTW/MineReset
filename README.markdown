Mine Reset
==========

Aren't you tired of manually selecting the mine region with World Edit, then typing in an incredibly long command that will reset the mining area while keeping the block pattern random? Tired of people going straight for the diamonds, the location of which they remember? I have good news for you.

With Mine Reset, all you need to do is set up an area, set up the block ratios using an easy-to-remember command, and now you can set it to a randomized pattern using one command, any time you want, anywhere you want. Even from the console! You can even stretch the use of the plugin to make it meet other purposes like resetting the spleef arena floor or do something even more weird.

Features
--------

 * Select a region with ease
 * Add a custom block ratio - all materials supported
 * Reset the mine with one command
 * Ability to have several mines, each with its own ratio
 * Permissions support; per-mine permissions!

Planned Future Features
-----------------------

 * Automatic resets at custom periods of time (custom for each mine)
 * Individual permission nodes for each mine Done!
 * Resetting a mine with a click of a button or by punching a sign. Or both!
 * Customize the messages!
 * Teleportation to the mine with a defined "mine spawn" point
 * Teleport players out of the mine before it resets
 * Select regions with World Edit wand!
 * You tell me!
